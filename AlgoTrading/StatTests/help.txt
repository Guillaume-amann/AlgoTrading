the presence of a _build directory, along with dune and dune-project files, is 
not strictly necessary if you’re compiling small projects or individual files 
using ocamlc or ocamlfind.

Explanation:

	•	.ml Files Only: If your project consists of just a few .ml files and 
        you’re manually compiling them, tools like ocamlc, ocamlfind, and 
        ocamlopt are enough.

	•	Dune Build System: Dune is a build system for OCaml projects that 
        automates the build process. It’s more useful when you have a more 
        complex project structure with multiple modules, dependencies, and 
        larger codebases.
